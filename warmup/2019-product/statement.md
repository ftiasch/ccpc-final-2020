# 2019

Given $a, b, c, d$, find the number of pairs of integers $(x, y)$ where $a \leq x \leq b, c \leq y \leq d$ and $x \cdot y$ is a multiple of $2019$.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases terminated by end-of-file. For each test case,

The first line contains four integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$.

* $1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^9$
* $1 \leq c \leq d \leq 10^9$
* In each input, the number of tests cases does not exceed $2 \times 10^5$.

## Output

For each test case, print an integer which denotes the result.
