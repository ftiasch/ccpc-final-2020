# 2015

Given an integer $n$, output the string \texttt{CCPC} for $\min\{n, 2015\}$ times.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases terminated by end-of-file. For each test case,

The first line contains an integer $n$.

* $1 \leq n \leq 10^9$
* In each input, the number of test cases does not exceed $10$.

## Output

For each test case, output $\min\{n, 2015\}$ strings.

The judge performs case-insensitive string comparision. Therefore, any spelling of \texttt{CCPC} is considered correct.
